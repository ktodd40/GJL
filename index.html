<!--Hello digital composer! Welcome to our Genius, Joy and Love Webtext. Just follow along and with comments like this, and you'll make a really cool web document that helps you process, package, and circulate your learning experience. Through the process, you'll learn a little bit about coding and computer science.-->

<!--When browsers access a web url, this index.html document is the first document it reads. The index.html serves as a roadmap for all of the information that the browser assembles on a screen. See if you can figure out what these two first lines of code are saying?-->

<!--Next is a link to the cascading style sheet or style.css file. Web designers use a cascading stylesheet to add styling to a website. Designers do this by "calling" a "class" in HTML and defining the class attributes on the style sheet. Doing so saves time and results in less code. On the style.css page you'll find attributes relating to font, text size, image size, among other details.-->

You don't need to do anything with the else with the code, but you do need to know that the style.css sheet controls and animates the hero image. To change the hero image, just add another jpg image to your project folder and rename it "hero.jpg".-->
